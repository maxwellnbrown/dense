# CSV Specification,,,,
#   Ignored by the file readers are:,,,,
#     (1) empty cells / blank rows / whitespace,,,,
#     (2) comment rows which always begin with a '#',,,,
#     (3) any cell that does not begin with a numerical or decimal place character*,,,,
#   *Such cells act as either column headers or other important notes. These are provided for the user's convenience and can be modified if the user sees fit.,,,,
# None of these comments include commas because it messes with the column widths when loaded into Excel-like programs. Speaking of that...,,,,
# For best results delete all comments before loading this file into any Excel-like program.,,,,
# Scientific notation in the form of 3.14e-41 is supported.,,,,
# It is futile to add/remove/modify the column headers with the expectation of changing the program's behavior. Data must be entered in the default order or must match the ordering of a respective command line argument.,,,,
# Rename this file by removing the ""_template"" from the file name (or just change the name entirely) once the data has been entered!",,,,
